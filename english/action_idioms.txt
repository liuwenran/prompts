make threatening gestures
scratch one 's ears and cheeks in embarrassment
dance with joy
look around
sharp eyes and agile hands or nimble fingers
to glance over things hurriedly
come swaggeringly
plug one 's ears while stealing a bell
beam with joy
show lack of judgment
as nimble as an escaping hare when going into action
run clandestine errands up and down the line
back and forth
go by like the wind
help the aged and the young
as cheerful as a lark
with vigorous strides
a hungry tiger at its prey
thump one 's chest and stamp one 's feet
blunder against
walk as if on wings
rush about telling the news around spreading
quick flow of writer 's thoughts and imagination
fly over the walls
make impromptu comic gestures and ramarks
look at fiercely as a tiger does
swiftly
attain the highest level in one step
being at a loss what to do
run amuck
Qiao Jie Wan Duan
take instant advantage of an opportunity that comes only once in a long while
smooth and clean
push one 's way by shoving or humping
go with head high and chest out
suddenly and swiftly
